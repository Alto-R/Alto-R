### Hi 👋, this is Churui Huang.

🏫 I am a current postgraduate student at Peking University.

🌱 My research interests are in smart cities and big data, with a current focus on convex optimization and reinforcement learning, aiming to leverage these techniques to build more intelligent and efficient urban systems.
